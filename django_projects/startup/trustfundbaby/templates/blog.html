        What is a Dividend Reinvestment Plan?

        A dividend Reinvestment Plan, otherwise known as DRIP, lets investors in the stock market reinvest their money from dividend payments, or regularly distributed payments from a company to its shareholders. These dividends are then reinvested, instead of paid out in cash, and are used to either purchase more shares or decrease the average cost-per-share of that asset.
    </p class = "blog-content">
        Dividend rates vary per stock and not all companies offer dividends to their shareholders. Dividends are also not guaranteed by the company issuing them, as they are often distributed based on the companyâ€™s sales growth throughout the year. To utilize DRIP, you can activate it on your brokerage app or via your brokerage firm. The convenience of using a DRIP allows you to automatically reinvest into a stock that you are holding long-term.
