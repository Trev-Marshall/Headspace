                    <b>What exactly is a 592 Savings Plan?</b>><br>
                    A 529 Savings Plan is an educational investment plan that allows tax breaks for educational based expenses. Similar to a Roth IRA, but with education in mind, the plan is a tax advantaged savings account focused on encouraging and easing future educational plans.

                    <b>What are the benefits associated with a 529 account?</b>
                    <br>
                    As your savings compound over a period of time, withdrawls associated with qualified educational expenses will not be subjeted to tax. This differs from a typical savings account where withdrawls are deemeda s capital gains and are thus taxed.

                    <b>What can my savings be spent on?</b>
                    <br>
                    Savings from the 529 plan can only be spent on qualified education expenses. There is a 10% tax penalty on unqualified noneducational expenses.
