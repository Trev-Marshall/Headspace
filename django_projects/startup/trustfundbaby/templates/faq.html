                        <b>What exactly is a 592 Savings Plan?</b><br>
                        A 529 Savings Plan is an educational investment plan that allows tax breaks for educational based expenses. Similar to a Roth IRA, but with education in mind, the plan is a tax advantaged savings account focused on encouraging and easing future educational plans.
                        <br>
                        <b>What are the benefits associated with a 529 account?</b>
                        <br>
                        As your savings compound over a period of time, withdrawls associated with qualified educational expenses will not be subjeted to tax. This differs from a typical savings account where withdrawls are deemeda s capital gains and are thus taxed.
                        <br>
                        <b>What can my savings be spent on?</b>
                        <br>
                        Savings from the 529 plan can only be spent on qualified education expenses. There is a 10% tax penalty on unqualified noneducational expenses.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        To avoid any taxes or penalties on withdrawls, your best option is to transfer the account to a new beneficiary who will use the money for educational expenses. Otherwise, the gains on any withdrawls from the account will be subjected to taxes and a 10% penalty.

                        <br>
                        While education accounts were originally created for college expenses, it's also possible to use the money for K-12 tuition. Qualified educational expenses include books, room and board, computer equipment, and tuition.
